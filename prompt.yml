# user_request
"""
I need to export data with the number of feasible and infeasible solutions for each hour. In the case of infeasible solutions, I need to know the reason why it is infeasible. I'm going to use this data to create and graphs. Also, for each complete feasible solution, I need to save them including the cost along the 24 hours. I think we could get it from the tree and node's lower bound.
